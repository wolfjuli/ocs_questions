\section*{Derivations}
Die Antworten sind teilweise unvollständig, einerseits, weil er die Antworten als "Eh Klar" abgestempelt hat, anderer seits weil er so schnell durchging, dass ein Mitschreiben nicht mehr möglich war. 

\begin{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Draw level lines and arrows
\begin{itemize}
\item objective function is the function we want to minimize
\item constraint set is a set of functions
\item optimal solution: find $f(x^*) \leq f(x), \forall x \in X$
\item level set: compareable to level lines of terrain, convex function $=>$ convex level set (but there are non convex fct with convex level sets), 
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Linear}: Objective Function and Constraints may only be linear
$min\ c^Tx, s.t.\ Ax \leq b, x \geq 0$\\
Polynomial solvable
\item \textbf{Non Linear}: Objective Function and Constriants may  be non linear
$min\ \frac{1}{2} x^TQx + c^Tx, s.t.\ Ax \leq b, Ex = d$\\
Q symmetrical and pos. definite, polynomial solvable
\item \textbf{Quadratic}: objective function is quadratic, constraints are linear	
$min_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\ f_0(x) \texttt{ (objective)},$\\
$s.t.\ f_i(x) \leq i=0..m \texttt{ (contraints)}$\\
polynomial time
\item \textbf{convex set}: 
$\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)y \ in X, \forall x, y \in X, \alpha \in [0, 1]$
\item \textbf{convex fct}:
$f(\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)y) \leq \alpha f(x) + (1 - \alpha)f(y) , \forall x, y \in X, \alpha \in [0, 1]$ 
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item When hessian is strictly positive, it is a strict global maximum

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item If positive and negative Eigenvalues, we can not define convexity
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Descent direction: angle of step and derivation direction $< 90^\circ$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Identity, Hessian, Gauss Newton, Diag Hessian, zik zak
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item upper bound, \sout{... too fast...}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Energy convergence 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item \sout{too fast}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item \sout{polynomial euqations, distance to std. Newton}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item incremental of gauss newton
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item \sout{too fast}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item \sout{iterative}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item nesterov in gradient, heavy-ball just in pai...
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item in subspace reduce to eq, what is a subspace?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item First pages of slide 10
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item middle/end of pages slide 10 - start in interior and just take small steps $->$ we can ignore constraint under these conditions
\item \sout{too fast}
\item Example 24.1. image
\item image 2
\item image 2
